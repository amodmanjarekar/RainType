# RainType

A simple infinitely running game made with Unity.

## Description

RainType is an endlessly scrolling typing game. Quickly input the falling letters and score as many points as you can before your lives run out!

This game was built as a quick skill showcase for recruitments, as well as to familiarize with the new Unity UIToolkit. Minimizing the development time for v1.0 of RainType was my primary concern, and thus decided to use a minimal amount of art assets including sprites and audio.

## Play the game

Download the game for your OS (Windows/Linux): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hMYxz4tyOqvYJoT1WeYPEhTenHQIbl68?usp=sharing

A WebGL version will be added soon :)
